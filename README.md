CoLab is a real-time collaboration platform that enables teams to work together efficiently and seamlessly on code and text-based projects. With CoLab, multiple users can simultaneously edit and collaborate on shared code files or documents, and changes are instantly synchronized in real-time, providing a smooth and productive collaboration experience.

## Key Features

- Real-time Collaboration: CoLab allows team members to collaborate in real-time, enabling them to see each other's changes instantaneously as they work together on shared code files or documents.

- Code Editing: The platform provides a powerful and intuitive code editor that supports syntax highlighting and other essential code editing features.

- File Sharing: Users can easily share code files or documents with their team members, making it convenient to collaborate on specific files or projects.

- Version History: CoLab automatically tracks version history, allowing users to roll back to previous versions and review changes made during collaboration sessions.

- Chat Integration: The platform includes an integrated chat feature that allows team members to communicate while collaborating, facilitating efficient discussions.

- Secure Authentication: CoLab implements a secure authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access and collaborate within team spaces.

## Problems Solved

Traditional collaborative coding or document editing often involves back-and-forth exchanges of files, leading to version conflicts and slower progress. CoLab addresses this issue by providing a real-time collaboration environment where all changes are synchronized instantly, allowing teams to work together without delays and conflicts.
